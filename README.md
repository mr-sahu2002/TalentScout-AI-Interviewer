## Technical Details

### Libraries Used
- **Streamlit**: For the frontend and interactive UI.
- **google.generativeai**: To interface with Google's Gemini Model for content generation.
- **PDFTextExtractor**: A custom utility for extracting text from PDF resumes.
- **dotenv**: To manage environment variables.
- **tempfile & os**: For temporary file handling.

### Model Details
- **Generative Model**: Gemini-1.5-Flash by Google Generative AI.
- **Purpose**: Used for structured information extraction and generating tailored interview questions.

### Architectural Decisions
- **Resume Analysis**: Designed to handle missing fields gracefully by providing placeholders or defaults.
- **Interview Questions**: Dynamically generated based on the context to simulate a real interview.
- **Interactive UI**: Streamlitâ€™s session state enables persistent state management for chat history and candidate data.

## Prompt Design

### Resume Analysis Prompt
The prompt is designed to:
- Extract structured information in JSON format.
- Handle inconsistencies or missing data with placeholders.
- Focus on key candidate details (e.g., name, email, experience, skills).

### Interview Assistant Prompt
The prompt adheres to the following:
- Simulates a friendly yet professional technical interviewer.
- Adapts questions based on candidate information and responses.
- Combines conversational and technical assessments.
- Includes fallback mechanisms for unclear inputs.


## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenges
1. **Parsing Incomplete Data**: Resumes often have missing or inconsistent fields.
2. **Dynamic Question Generation**: Ensuring questions remain contextually relevant and engaging.
3. **Handling Large PDFs**: Managing file size limits and optimizing text extraction.

### Solutions
1. **Graceful Handling of Missing Fields**: Introduced placeholders and defaults for missing data.
2. **Context-Aware Prompts**: Designed robust prompts to dynamically adapt to candidate profiles.
3. **File Size Validation**: Set a 10MB file size limit to ensure efficient processing.

## Future implmentation 
1. **Text to Speech (TTS) Integration** **& Speech to Text (STT) Integration**
2. **Code Editor for Technical Questions**
3. **AI Proctoring for Monitoring Interview Integrity**
